# Preezie Coding Challange

## Problem

The task was to create a wizard style questionaire to test a users Star Wars knowledge.

## Install

- Make sure you have node and a package manager installed (i used [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))
- run `pnpm i`

## Design decissions

- I left notes throughout the code where i thought an explanation would be useful for why something was done a particular way.
